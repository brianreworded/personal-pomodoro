Each workout includes:

Stretches: butterfly, hamstring stretch, neck rolls, arm circles, etc.

Calisthenics: push-ups, sit-ups, squats, lunges, jumping jacks, etc.

Workout Completion

Same completion mechanics as tasks (checkbox, strikethrough, fade to grey, confetti)
After completion, popup asking for difficulty feedback:

"Too Easy" - increases difficulty for future similar exercises
"Just Right" - maintains current difficulty level
"Too Hard" - decreases difficulty for future similar exercises
